<h3>WindowBuilder</h3>
<div id="introText">

<p class="left">WindowBuilder is a powerful and easy to use bi-directional Java GUI designer.</p>

<p class="right"> This project was just provisioned.  You can see the proposal 
<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/proposals/tools.windowbuilder/">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
WindowBuilder is composed of SWT Designer and Swing Designer and makes it very easy to create Java GUI applications without spending 
a lot of time writing code to display simple forms. With WindowBuilder Pro you can create complicated windows in minutes. 
Use the visual designer and Java code will be generated for you. You can easily add controls using drag-and-drop, add event 
handlers to your controls, change various properties of controls using a property editor, internationalize your app and 
much more.
</p>
<p>
WindowBuilder Pro is built as a plug-in to Eclipse and the various Eclipse-based IDEs (RAD, RSA, MyEclipse, JBuilder, etc.). 
The plug-in builds an abstract syntax tree (AST) to navigate the source code and uses GEF to display and manage the visual 
presentation.
</p>
<p>
Using WYSIWYG layout tools, you don't need to write any lines of java code - the code will be generated for you by WindowBuilder 
Pro. You can easily add any component to a container by using drag-and-drop, add an event handler to your controls, change 
various properties of controls using property editors and much more. Generated code doesn't require any additional custom 
libraries to compile and run: all of the generated code can be used without having WindowBuilder Pro installed. WindowBuilder 
Pro can read and write almost any format and reverse-engineer most hand-written Java GUI code. It also supports free form 
code editing (make changes anywhere...not just in special areas) and most user refactorings (you can move, rename and 
subdivide methods without a problem).
