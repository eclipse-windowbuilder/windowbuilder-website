WindowBuilder is composed of SWT Designer and Swing Designer and makes it very easy to create Java GUI applications 
without spending a lot of time writing code. Use the WYSIWYG visual designer and layout tools to create simple forms 
to complex windows; the Java code will be generated for you. Easily add controls using drag-and-drop, add event handlers 
to your controls, change various properties of controls using a property editor, internationalize your app and much more.

WindowBuilder is built as a plug-in to Eclipse and the various Eclipse-based IDEs (RAD, RSA, MyEclipse, JBuilder, etc.). 
The plug-in builds an abstract syntax tree (AST) to navigate the source code and uses GEF to display and manage the visual 
presentation.
</p>
<p>
Generated code doesn't require any additional custom libraries to compile and run: all of the generated code can be 
used without having WindowBuilder installed. WindowBuilder can read and write almost any format and reverse-engineer 
most hand-written Java GUI code. It also supports free-form code editing (make changes anywhere, not just in special areas) 
and most user refactorings (you can move, rename and subdivide methods without a problem).
